This is a new [**React Native Expo**](https://expo.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`expo-router`](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).

# TuRain Lead Management System

TuRain Lead Management System is a React Native Expo project designed for efficient lead tracking and management.

## Project Overview

TuRain Lead Management System simplifies lead tracking and management, providing a user-friendly interface for businesses to organize and follow up on leads effectively.

## Getting Started 

### Step 1: Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarkKingStar/turain_lead_management
```


### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native Expo.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native Expo project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
